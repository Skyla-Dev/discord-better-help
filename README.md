An extension module for [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/ "discord.py PyPi page") to make setting up a help command easier.

Notices:
-------
* This module is **DEPRECATED** it no longer works with newer versions of discord.py and I have no intentions currently to update/fix this. I would recommend using discord-pretty-help as that is still being worked on from what I am aware.
    * Feel free however to use this code as long as you abide the license
* This module was based off of [discord-pretty-help](https://pypi.org/project/discord-pretty-help/ "discord-pretty-help PyPi page") by [StroupBSlayen](https://pypi.org/user/StroupBSlayen/ "StroupBSlayen PyPi profile").
* This module was designed for [discord.py](https://pypi.org/project/discord.py/ "discord.py PyPi page") 1.7+ but may work with older versions, use at your own risk however.
